## Installation :rocket:

### MongoDB 

In order to run the application you must have [**MongoDB :seedling:**](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed or you can use [**Docker :whale2:**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). The configuration to be able to lift a container is as follows:

1. Builds Docker images based on the configuration in docker-compose.yml.

    ```sh
    $ docker-compose build
    ```

2. Start containers based on the built images.

    ```sh
    $ docker-compose up
    ```

### API

Download and configure the necessary dependencies for the application and run the application.

```sh
$ npm install
    
$ npm run dev
```

Build the project

```sh
$ npm run build

$ npm run start
```

## Things to consider

Images are not saved in a database, they are saved in the project. In the `public/images` folder.

You can access them through the following url: `http://localhost:3000/images/A3sG8jK.jpg` :upside_down_face: :slightly_smiling_face: .
